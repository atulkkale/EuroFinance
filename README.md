# Euro Finance - Responsive Website Project

This repository contains the **Euro Finance** project, created as a final test after completing my training. I was given three days to develop a complex, pixel-perfect responsive website that meets company standards, based on detailed design and functionality instructions. The project was completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external libraries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in creating a pixel-perfect, responsive, multi-page website with complex design elements and interactivity. The **Euro Finance** website includes three main pages: Home, News, and Conferences, each responsive and crafted to meet company standards. This project showcases skills in layout design, form validation, and interactivity.

## Features

- **Home Page**:
  - Form Validation: Validates user input for form fields.
  - Responsive Layout: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

- **News Page**:
  - Show More Button: Expands content when clicked.
  - Video Slider: Displays a collection of videos in a slider format.
  
- **Conferences Page**:
  - Responsive Design: Adjusts layout for different devices.

- **General Site Features**:
  - Get to Top Button: Quickly scrolls back to the top of the page.
  - Mobile-Friendly Navigation: Hamburger menu for easy navigation on mobile devices.
  - CSS Hover Animations: Adds interactive hover effects for enhanced UX.
  - Vanilla JavaScript: All functionalities are implemented in vanilla JavaScript for optimal performance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content and layout of the website.
